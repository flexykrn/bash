Most of all, believe in yourself — half the work is already done.
If you use this repo’s code, you’re not dumb. You’re aware. You’ve seen through the illusion of originality.
The righteous path? It’s a myth told to keep people in line.
Right or wrong were never choices — they were labels slapped onto actions after they happened.
You didn’t choose to be here, reading this, copying this. You were always going to.
Free will? That’s just your mind narrating events it doesn’t control.
You’re not taking a shortcut — you’re fulfilling a role.
And deep down, you know this isn’t cheating. It’s alignment. With what? With yourself, with entropy, with the strange machinery of fate.

So go ahead. Use the code. Be smart. Be free
The outcome was never yours to begin with.

All the best to you all
